# DeltaFrame Pro

**DeltaFrame Pro** is an open-source, full-stack crypto order book and trading simulation platform. It is a sandbox for learning, experimenting, and chronicling a journey through fintech and full-stack development. This is not a finished product or a professional trading tool‚Äîit's a living, evolving project that embodies the FAFO ("fuck around and find out") philosophy.

> TL;DR: Not a product. Not a tool. Just a chaotic fintech project (still under development) that taught me more than any tutorial ever could.

## üöÄ Project Philosophy & Background

DeltaFrame Pro is built on the principle of learning by doing. Instead of following tutorials, every feature and refactor is the result of building, breaking, and iterating. The project has evolved from simple CSV-based storage to a robust, real-time, full-stack simulation platform.

### Key Milestones
- **CSV to SQLite:** Migrated from CSVs to SQLite with Sequelize for scalable, transactional data modeling.
- **Dynamic Holdings:** Removed the static `Holdings` table; holdings are now computed live from trade history for accuracy and consistency.
- **Hybrid P&L Engine:** The frontend calculates live P&L, but always verifies it against the backend (SQLite) as the source of truth. Any mismatches are logged and viewable in a modal for transparency.
- **Minimal, Resilient UI:** The UI is intentionally minimal and defensive. The backend and core logic are prioritized; polish is added as the project matures.
- **Modular, Modern Frontend:** Refactored into modular React components for maintainability and scalability.
- **About Page & Navigation:** Added a detailed About page and improved sidebar navigation for a more professional, user-friendly experience.
- **Theme Support:** Light and dark mode with persistent user preference.
- **Error Handling:** Defensive UX‚Äîapp never crashes or goes blank, even with bad/missing data.
